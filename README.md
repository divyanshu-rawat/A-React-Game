### Live Application

##

#### Description  

* When the game starts, you get a random number of stars between 1 and 9, and you have the set of numbers in the
  bottom frame that you can use.
* You can select one or more numbers that would sum up to the value of the random stars.
  The objective is to correctly use all the numbers here in the bottom frame. If you end up with a number of stars that has     no possible correct combination, you get to redraw, which you can do five times.
* After that, if you still end up with a  number of stars that has no possible correct combination out of all the remaining  
  numbers, then you lose the game.
