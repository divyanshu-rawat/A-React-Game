#### Description  

* When the game starts, you get a random number of stars between 1 and 9, and you have the set of numbers in the bottom  
 frame that you can use. You can select one or more numbers that would sum up to the value of the random stars. The 
 objective is to correctly use all the numbers here in the bottom frame. If you end up with a number of stars that has no 
 possible correct combination, you get to redraw, which you can do five times. After that, if you still end up with a number 
 of stars that has no possible correct combination out of all the remaining numbers, then you lose the game.
